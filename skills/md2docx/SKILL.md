# Markdown to Word (DOCX)

Convert markdown to formatted Word documents with citations using the `md2docx` script at [scripts/md2docx](scripts/md2docx).

## Usage

```bash
md2docx input.md                       # default theme
md2docx --theme gl input.md            # Growth Lab theme
md2docx input.md output.docx           # custom output path
md2docx --theme gl input.md out.docx   # GL theme + custom output
md2docx --list-themes                  # show available themes
```

**Always use `md2docx`** — do not use raw pandoc commands directly.

## Themes

Bundled themes live in [assets/templates/](assets/templates/):

| Theme     | Description                                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default` | Original template (Garamond, 12pt, Office colors)                    |
| `gl`      | Growth Lab design system (Source Serif 4 + Inter, ink ramp, GL chart palette — see `grammar.md` and `recipes/report.md`) |

The `--theme` flag selects a reference document from `assets/templates/{name}.docx`. All themes share the same Lua filter, citation style, and cross-reference support.

The `gl` template is generated — never edit it by hand. Rebuild with:

```bash
python3 assets/build_gl_template.py   # template.docx → templates/gl.docx + gl.dotx
```

## Using the GL theme manually in Word (no pipeline)

Give manual-Word users `assets/templates/gl.dotx` — double-clicking it
creates a new document from the template (the `.docx` twin is for pandoc).
The document opens as a **starter page** that documents itself: cover roles
(Title / Subtitle / Author / Date), headings, a complete figure block, and a
styled table, all applied from named styles in the Styles gallery.

- **Figures**: copy-paste the sample five-paragraph figure block. Its number
  is a live `SEQ Figure` field — Word renumbers on field update (Ctrl+A,
  F9) and the figures appear in References → Cross-reference. Don't use
  Word's Insert Caption for figures (wrong shape — single paragraph below
  the image).
- **Tables**: apply the `Table` table style (Table Design gallery); caption
  above in `Table Caption` with a `SEQ Table` field (the starter shows one).
- **TOC / footnotes / citations**: References → Table of Contents,
  References → Insert Footnote, and Zotero's bibliography all land on
  GL-styled rails automatically.
- The figure styles are priority-clustered in the Styles pane (label →
  title → subtitle → image → source); pipeline-only plumbing styles
  (`Compact`, `Body Text`, …) are hidden from the ribbon gallery.

## Figure blocks (GL theme)

The GL theme renders Nil's five-element figure block. Author figures as:

```markdown
![Chart title ending in a period. // Optional subtitle](chart.png){#fig:label}

Source: Growth Lab analysis of UN Comtrade.
```

This becomes: `FIGURE N` eyebrow (accent, uppercase) → chart title (serif) →
subtitle (optional, ink-3) → image → source (serif italic), kept together on
one page. Same ` // ` convention as md2pdf. A `Source:`/`Note:` paragraph
immediately after the image is styled as the figure source. Consecutive
images (2–3) render side-by-side with merged captions — note LibreOffice
preview stacks them vertically; real Word renders them side-by-side.

Word-fidelity limits (sizes 1px→1pt, bold-for-500, full-width title rule,
empty TOC until fields update) are listed in `followups.md` §10.

## Requirements

- A `references.bib` file must exist in the same directory as the input markdown file
- The script will error if no `.bib` file is found

## How It Works

Uses pandoc with all resources bundled in [assets/](assets/):
- **Reference doc**: [assets/template.docx](assets/template.docx) (custom Word template for styles)
- **Citation style**: [assets/citation-style.csl](assets/citation-style.csl) (Harvard author-date)
- **Filters**: `pandoc-crossref` (for figure/table/equation cross-references) and `--citeproc` (for bibliography)
- **Lua filter**: [scripts/growthlabbify.lua](scripts/growthlabbify.lua) (figure titles above images, side-by-side layout, source captions, keep-together, boxes)
- **Sections**: Numbered, with table of contents (depth 3)

## Markdown Citation Syntax

Use standard pandoc citation syntax:

```markdown
As shown by @smith2023, the results indicate...
Several studies [@jones2021; @smith2023] have found...
```

## Cross-Reference Syntax (pandoc-crossref)

```markdown
![Caption text](image.png){#fig:label}

See @fig:label for details.

| Col A | Col B |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | 2     |

: Table caption {#tbl:label}

See @tbl:label for the data.
```

## Boxes

Use pandoc fenced divs with class `box` to create bordered, shaded callout boxes (rendered as single-cell tables in Word):

```markdown
::: {.box title="Box 1: Key Findings"}
First paragraph of the box.

Second paragraph with **bold** and *italic* formatting.

- Bullet lists work too
:::
```

The `title` attribute is optional. Boxes support paragraphs, bold/italic/code formatting, and bullet/numbered lists.
